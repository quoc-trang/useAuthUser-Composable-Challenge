# useAuthUser Composable Challenge

In this challenge, there is a bug preventing the login form from redirecting to the user's profile page after successful login. Your task is to figure out why the bug exists and fix it!

## Requirements

1. The app should continue to use the `useAuthUser` composable to keep up with the logged in user's data
2. After login with a valid username and password, the page should redirect to the user's profile
3. The profile page should show the data corresponding to the user that logged in

> ðŸ’¡ HINT: There are 2 available users to test with: `janedoe` and `johndoe`. They both have the password `vueisawesome`
